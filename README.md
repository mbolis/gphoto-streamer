# GPhoto Streamer
> Stream photos from your camera to [linuxstopmotion](http://linuxstopmotion.org/index.html) over [gphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/gphoto2)

GPhoto Streamer is a tool born from two main needs:
* make my digital camera usable from linuxstopmotion (now that I know it's [usable from gphoto2](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2/issues/325))
* have some practice with Kotlin

The Streamer shows a crude toolbar from where one can start and stop image acquisition as a stream of low-res thumbnails, while moving pieces on the scene. Then, once one's satisfied with their job, they may take high-resolution snapshots using the camera button.

## Installation

Install gphoto2. Make shure to grab the latest version of libgphoto2 that supports your camera.

Clone the repository and build:
```sh
./gradlew clean shadowJar
```

Copy the jar and the startup script under a $PATH folder:
```sh
cp build/libs/gphoto-streamer-*-all.jar ~/.local/lib
cp gphoto-streamer ~/.local/bin
```

## Usage

Use the tool in dialog mode:
```sh
gphoto-streamer runonce <captured file path>
```

Start the tool:
```sh
gphoto-streamer start <captured file path>
```

Kill it with:
```sh
gphoto-streamer stop
```

## Integration with linuxstopmotion
